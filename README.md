# Graphics Programming with Python
CIS 510, Fall 2015, University of Oregon

This repository contains materials used for the Fall 2015 course, Graphics Programming with Python (CIS 510), taught by Kent Stevens. From the course description:

>This course provides an introduction to 3D digital modeling, animation, and rendering in Python, with relevance to application areas including scientific visualization, digital modeling asset creation, and multimedia production. Prior knowledge of graphics not required, but Python proficiency is presumed. Students will develop a term-long project that involves aspects of 3D modeling, animation, and rendering. Development will be in Python (exclusively), the Autodesk Maya API, the Pycharm IDE, and QT for UI building.  All student projects will share some common elements of framework and workflow, with considerable latitude given to choice of application topic and area of concentration, and visualization methods.  One may either work individually or in two-person teams.  Graphics topics will include meshes, subdivision surface modeling and particles, material properties, shaders and lighting, camera and object animation, UI building and scripting.
